% ************************************************************
% This algorithm is part of a methodology proposed to automate the mix design process for 3D concrete 
% printing applications. Multiobjective Pareto optimization is used with the aim of developing a mix that 
% meets the desired properties and simultaneously reduces the material and time required to be developed. 
% The algorithm can edit up to eight factors, where three of them are qualitative and the remaining five 
% are treated as quantitative factors. These parameters are the water-to-binder ratio, the sand-to-binder 
% ratio, the dosage of the superplasticizer, the dosage of the biopolymer polysaccharide viscosity 
% modifying agent, and the dosage of crystalline calcium silicate hydrate. The user can select the ratio 
% or the dosage range for each factor. The output of the Pareto optimization algorithm is a new set of 
% mixes with properties closer to the desired values by respecting the trade-offs between them. All the 
% Pareto optimal solutions can be considered equally desirable. The user is responsible for selecting the  
% most preferred ones.
