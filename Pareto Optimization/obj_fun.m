% ************************************************************
% This routine is part of a methodology proposed to automate the mix design process for 3D concrete 
% printing applications. The objective functions of the multiobjective algorithm are the generated neural 
% networks. The three targets are the improvement of the workability, buildability, and compressive 
% strength. The algorithm is used to simultaneously optimize the values of the three properties and the 
% user can select to minimize, maximize or set a target value for each of the properties.
